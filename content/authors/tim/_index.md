My name is Tim and I'm a Scientific Programmer at the University of Amsterdam. I work with other PhD students and professors to support their research, usually technically but generally where possible. I'm happiest when that work involves writing compilers ([eFLINT](https://gitlab.com/eflint)) or workflow systems ([BRANE](https://github.com/epi-project/brane)).

In my spare time I like drumming, reading, cycling gaming and programming (I swear it's different programming from my work). I also hang out a lot with my friends and colleagues.
