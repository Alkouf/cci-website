<H2>About Daphnee</H2>
<p>
My name is Daphnee Chabal and I am a PhD candidate in the Complex Cyber Infrastructure (CCI) group. Being supervised by Zoltan Mann, I will conduct research in the theme of Security and Privacy in Edge AI.  My research will focus on creating a performant and secure technique to deploy deep neural networks in edge computing (distributed) systems. Differently put, how to run resource-hungry algorithms in resource-constraints devices, such as IoT objects, while making sure incoming, in-process, and outgoing information remains private. I am French-Korean, so I definitely enjoy food. A United World College graduate, Iâ€™ve lived and studied in 8 countries spread over 4 continents. I always enjoy meeting people from all horizons, learning from/trying their ways of life, expanding my world view on any topic in the process. I also like mountain trekking, swimming, climbing, kickboxing, and boardgames. Cheers!
