This repo uses https://gohugo.io/ for building the website https://cci-research.nl/. 

## How To Make

After installing `hugo` you can go to the root directory of the project and run `hugo server` to see a preview of the built website on the local host.

Running `hugo` will build the website and put the files into `/public` directory, which is a git submodule to the github pages repository, then go the `/public` dirctory and `add`, `commit` and `push` it to its own repo. changes will take a few minutes to take place online.
