<h2>About Aleandro</h2>
<p>Hi! I'm Aleandro, originally from Malta. Currently, my research at the University of Amsterdam centers around Software Engineering, with a special emphasis on Software Testing. I also have a keen interest in exploring various programming languages and the visualization of programming languages in general.</p>

<p>Beyond my academic pursuits, I find joy in learning, music, nature, and spending time with friends.</p>
