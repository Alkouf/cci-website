<p>The paper titled <b>Introducing Normative Advisors into MAS</b> by Mostafa Mohajeri Parizi, Thomas van Binsbergen, Giovanni Sileno and Tom van Engers was accepted at <a href="http://www.ccc.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/eumas2022/">The 19th European Conference on Multi-Agent Systems</a>.
</p>
<h3>Abstract:</h3>
<p>This paper introduces a modular architecture for integrating norms in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. As the the interactions between norms and agents can be complex, this architecture utilizes multiple programmable components to model concepts such as adoption of multiple personal and/or collective possibly conflicting norms, interpretation and qualification between social and normative contexts, possibility of intentionally (non-)compliant behaviors and resolving conflicts between norms and desires (or other norms). The architecture revolves around <i>normative advisors</i> that act as the bridge between intentional agents and the institutional reality. As a technical contribution, a running implementation of the architecture is presented based on the ASC2 (AgentScript) BDI framework and eFLINT norm reasoner.</p>
