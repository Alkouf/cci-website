[Dr. Zoltan Mann](https://cci-research.nl/author/zoltan-mann/) gave an invited talk at this year's [Privacy Symposium](https://privacysymposium.org/), in the session *From Cloud to Edge Security*. Entitled **Edge intelligence: friend or foe? (for security and privacy)**, Zoltan's presentation discussed the security and privacy implications of artificial intelligence in edge computing. It drew attention to the recent BDVA position paper [Current Hot Topics in Data Protection](https://cci-research.nl/post/bdva-pospaper-2022/) as well CCI's recently started EU research project [SECURED](https://secured-project.eu/).
