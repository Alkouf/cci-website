The DMI ecosystem is a public-private partnership that facilitates the responsible sharing and use of
data on a solid foundation of mutual trust, clear agreements and open standards. This creates new
business opportunities for a variety of market players, which in turn enables government bodies to
give concrete form and substance to mobility innovation and smart and sustainable urbanisation.
The DMI ecosystem ensures a better connection between the various domains and stakeholders, in
order to be able to optimise continuously and coherently on that same basis. As a result, the
intended agglomeration effects and a sustainable society with vibrant towns and cities will be
achieved faster.
