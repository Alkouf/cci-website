The paper "UMLsec4Edge: Extending UMLsec to model data-protection-compliant edge computing systems" has been accepted as a full paper at the 48th Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA 2022).
The paper, authored by [Zoltan Mann](https://cci-research.nl/author/zoltan-mann/) with co-authors from the University of Duisburg-Essen, presents a new UML profile for improved modeling of data protection aspects in edge computing systems.
The practical applicability of the new UML profile is demonstrated with the use cases of the EU-funded research project FogProtect.
