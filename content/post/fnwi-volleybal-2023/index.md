Out of the 16 teams participating, the [*The Daltons*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5659248/)
look-alikes with fellow members of the MNS and PCS research groups from our SNE
cluster, managed to conquer the 11th place. A very nice result for the first
particpation, which we could not have achieved without our dedicated SNE
supporters that kept cheering for us until the very end. A special thanks to you!
