abstract: Normative positions are sometimes illustrated in diagrams, in particular
  in didactic contexts. Traditional examples are the Aristotelian polygons of opposition
  for deontic modalities (squares, triangles, hexagons, etc.), and the Hohfeldian
  squares for obligative and potestative concepts. Relying on previous work, we show
  that Hohfeldâ€™s framework can be used as a basis for developing several Aristotelian
  polygons and more complex diagrams. Then, we illustrate how logical theories of
  increasing strength can be built based on these diagrams, and how those theories
  enable us to determine in a computably efficient way whether a set of normative
  positions can be derived from another set of normative positions.
