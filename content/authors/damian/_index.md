<h2> Hello there </h2>
<p>
  I am fascinated by programming languages: they are the optimal form of abstraction. Hence, making it easier to construct new programming languages is the main focus of my research. As part of this effort, I want to integrate the design process with exploratory programming --- a style of programming where the goal worked towards is not fully concrete. This integration enables a highly volatile style of language development, making it easy to try out different design choices and reach the optimal language earlier.

 If you're still reading and are curious about me personally: I am born and raised in Almere, the Netherlands. Or, as I would like to say, the most beautiful city in the Netherlands. In my spare time, I enjoy taking a walk, cycle, and meet friends to have a drink.
