<p>The paper titled <b>Regulatory Services to Automate Compliance with Ex-post Enforcement</b> by Lu-Chi Liu, Mostafa Mohajeri Parizi, Thomas van Binsbergen, and Tom van Engers was accepted at <a href="http://www.aicol.eu/">AICOL 2022: AI Approaches to the Complexity of Legal Systems</a>.

<h3>Abstract:</h3>
<p>Software systems are expected to comply with norms from a variety of sources. However, the increasing volume and the dynamism of norms make it rather difficult to have a fully compliant software system by design. This paper proposes a generic architecture of regulated software systems that facilitates compliance with high-level policies through regulatory services. Our architectural model has the flexibility to adapt to norm modifications and to norm violations by including ex-post enforcement mechanisms. The proposed solution is assessed using a case study and a prototype implementation in the eFLINT and ASC2 languages for modeling norms and software/social agents respectively.</p>
