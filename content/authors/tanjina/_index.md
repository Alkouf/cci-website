<h2> About Tanjina </h2>
<p> My name is Tanjina Islam, and I joined the Complex Cyber Infrastructure (CCI) group as a PhD student in February 2023. As part of my research, I will be working on Energy consumption and the Security of Machine Learning (ML) Applications in the Cloud-to-Edge Continuum, which aims to devise a technique to improve the energy cost of the ML pipeline while preserving their security and privacy. I was born and raised in Bangladesh, which is called a land of rivers. In 2017, I moved to the Netherlands to pursue my master's in Computer science specializing in Software Engineering and Green IT.  I also worked as a Software Engineer in the IT industry for about three years back in my home country.

<p> I am very passionate about photography. I love to take pictures and draw silly things during my spare time. I also like to wander around aimlessly and often go for a long walk in the woods.
