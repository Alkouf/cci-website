# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
# bio: The complexity of man made systems on all scales is my research field. Cyber Infrastructure is rapidly evolving from relatively simple fixed components to programmable and virtualized objects with many degrees of freedom, owned,  operated and governed by different entities in multiple administrative connected domains on the Internet. Harnessing this complexity in a transparent trust-able way for safe and secure data processing is a major research topic that nowadays defines the focus in my research. I chair the Complex Cyber Infrastructure research group that hosts this research line.

interests:
- AI and law
- AI and ethics
- Formal representation of legal knowledge 
- Computational modelling of legal reasoning and argumentation, 
- Formal and computational models of ethics
- Trust in multi-agent systems

## About Tomasz:

I am employed as a post-doc researcher at the Complex Cyber Infrastructure group, where I am part of the TRUST RPA project. I am also an Associate Fellow of T.M.C. Asser Institute in The Hague, and an assistant professor at the Institute of Computer Science at Maria Curie Sklodowska University in Lublin, Poland (currently on leave). I have got MA in management (1999) and Ph.D. in computer science (2004). My dissertation concerns utilisation of artificial intelligence in banking. My main research interests are focused on computational representation of legal and ethical reasoning. I am an author of over 50 peer-reviewed papers, member of program committees of main AI and Law conferences, and a member of International Association of Artificial Intelligence and Law. My recent activities also include a research visit at Swansea University (2020), the position of Artificial Intelligence Expert for Deep Clue sp. z o. o. (2020 â€“ 2021), as well as work on grant projects and initiatives dedicated to sharing, supporting, and popularizing knowledge.  I am also music lover and musician specializing in playing blues on electric and acoustic guitars.
