<h2>About Andrea</h2>
<p>
I'm currently doing my PhD with my supervisor <a href="/author/tom/">Tom van Engers</a>, and my co-supervisors <a href="/author/gio/">Giovanni Sileno</a> and <a href="/author/thomas/">Thomas van Binsbergen</a>, where I'm working on automating the generation and orchestration of norm-compliant cloud services in the context of governmental agencies.
