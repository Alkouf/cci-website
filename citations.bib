	abstract = {Exploratory programming is a form of incremental program development in which the programmer can try and compare definitions, receives immediate feedback and can simultaneously experiment with the language, the program and input data. Read-Eval-Print-Loop interpreters (REPLs) and computational notebooks are popular tools for exploratory programming. However, their usability, capabilities and user-friendliness are strongly dependent on the underlying interpreter and, in particular, on the ad hoc engineering required to ready the underlying interpreter for incremental program development. To break this dependency, this paper adopts a principled approach and implements a so-called exploring interpreter as a back-end to support various development environments for exploratory programming.},

	abstract = {Read-eval-print-loops (REPLs) allow programmers to test out snippets of code, explore APIs, or even incrementally construct code, and get immediate feedback on their actions. However, even though many languages provide a REPL, the relation between the language as is and what is accepted at the REPL prompt is not always well-defined. Furthermore, implementing a REPL for new languages, such as DSLs, may incur significant language engineering cost. In this paper we survey the domain of REPLs and investigate the (formal) principles underlying REPLs. We identify and define the class of sequential languages, which admit a sound REPL implementation based on a definitional interpreter, and present design guidelines for extending existing language implementations to support REPL-style interfaces (including computational notebooks). The obtained REPLs can then be generically turned into an exploring interpreter, to allow exploration of the user's interaction. The approach is illustrated using three case studies, based on MiniJava, QL (a DSL for questionnaires), and eFLINT (a DSL for normative rules). We expect sequential languages, and the consequent design principles, to be stepping stones towards a better understanding of the essence of REPLs.},

The increase of insurgency conflicts creates a need to understand how insurgencies arise, and to identify societal drivers of insurgencies or effective strategies to counter them. In this paper, we analyze the contributions of computational modeling methods for the analysis of insurgent conflicts. We formalize a specific literature-based analysis framework using the identified key factors and drivers, which enables the evaluation of specific models in this domain. Through a systematic literature search, we identify 64 computational models to apply our framework. We highlight the development and contributions of various methodologies through an in-depth analysis of 13 high-quality models. The evaluation of these computational models revealed promising directions and future topics to design specific simulation models for all identified factors. In addition, our analysis revealed specific pitfalls concerning validity issues for each of the modeling methods.},

	abstract = {Under international law, weapon capabilities and their use are regulated by legal requirements set by International Humanitarian Law (IHL). Currently, there are strong military incentives to equip capabilities with increasingly advanced artificial intelligence (AI), which include opaque (less transparent) models. As opaque models sacrifice transparency for performance, it is necessary to examine whether their use remains in conformity with IHL obligations. First, we demonstrate that the incentives for automation drive AI toward complex task areas and dynamic and unstructured environments, which in turn necessitates resort to more opaque solutions. We subsequently discuss the ramifications of opaque models for foreseeability and explainability. Then, we analyse their impact on IHL requirements from a development, pre-deployment and post-deployment perspective. We find that while IHL does not regulate opaque AI directly, the lack of foreseeability and explainability frustrates the fulfilment of key IHL requirements to the extent that the use of fully opaque AI could violate international law. States are urged to implement interpretability during development and seriously consider the challenging complication of determining the appropriate balance between transparency and performance in their capabilities.},

	abstract = {In both hardware and software, masking can represent an effective means of hardening an implementation against side-channel attack vectors such as Differential Power Analysis (DPA). Focusing on software, however, the use of masking can present various challenges: specifically, it often 1) requires significant effort to translate any theoretical security properties into practice, and, even then, 2) imposes a significant overhead in terms of efficiency. To address both challenges, this paper explores the use of an Instruction Set Extension (ISE) to support masking in software-based implementations of a range of (symmetric) cryptographic kernels including AES: we design, implement, and evaluate such an ISE, using RISC-V as the base ISA. Our ISE-supported first-order masked implementation of AES, for example, is an order of magnitude more efficient than a software-only alternative with respect to both execution latency and memory footprint; this renders it comparable to an unmasked implementation using the same metrics, but also first-order secure.},

	issn = {1558-2183},
	doi = {10.1109/TPDS.2022.3148985},
	abstract = {In recent years, cloud computing concepts have been extended towards the network edge, leading to paradigms like edge computing and fog computing. As a result, applications can be placed on a variety of resources, including fog nodes and cloud data centers. Application placement has significant impact on important metrics like latency. Finding an optimal application placement is computationally challenging, particularly because of the potentially huge number of infrastructure nodes and application components. To overcome the limited scalability of application placement algorithms, optimization can be decentralized, i.e., performed separately for different parts of the infrastructure. The infrastructure can be split into fog colonies, where a fog colony consists of the computational resources in a given geographical region. Application placement can then be performed for the individual fog colonies, thus mitigating the scalability problem. However, independent optimization of application placement in different fog colonies may lead to missed synergies and thus to sub-optimal overall results. Hence, some kind of coordination between fog colonies may be beneficial. In this paper, we analyze the effects of decentralization and coordination on the optimization results. In particular, we compare empirically four different approaches: (i) centralized decision-making, where decisions are made in one go for the entire infrastructure, (ii) independent fog colonies, where optimization is carried out in each fog colony independently from each other, (iii) fog colonies with communication, where excess application components in one fog colony can be sent to a neighboring fog colony, and (iv) fog colonies with overlaps, where shared resources may be dynamically distributed between neighboring fog colonies. Our experiments show that, for large problem instances, decentralization combined with coordination leads to the best results.},

	issn = {1939-1374},
	doi = {10.1109/TSC.2022.3144645},
	abstract = {An edge data center can host applications that require low-latency access to nearby end devices. If the resource requirements of the applications exceed the capacity of the edge data center, some non-latency-critical application components may be offloaded to the cloud. Such offloading may incur financial costs both for the use of cloud resources and for data transfer between the edge data center and the cloud. Moreover, such offloading may violate data protection requirements if components process sensitive data. The operator of the edge data center has to decide which components to keep in the edge data center and which ones to offload to the cloud. In this paper, we formalize this problem and prove that it is strongly NP-hard. We introduce an optimization algorithm that is fast enough to be run online for dynamic and automatic offloading decisions, guarantees that the solution satisfies hard constraints regarding latency, data protection, and capacity, and achieves near-optimal costs. We also show how the algorithm can be extended to handle multiple edge data centers. Experiments show that the cost of the solution found by our algorithm is on average only 2.7\% higher than the optimum.},

	abstract = {Applications for the Internet of Things (IoT) may use, beyond the IoT devices themselves, also edge and cloud resources. Thus, the modules of an application can be placed on a variety of nodes with different capabilities in terms of security, trustworthiness, and capacity. Application modules may exist in multiple instances. This makes it possible to assign users to the most appropriate module instances, taking into account requirements on security, privacy, and latency. There is a non-trivial interplay between application placement decisions and user assignment decisions. For example, if a certain user is assigned to a module, then that module may not be allowed to be placed on nodes not trusted by the user. However, most existing research neglects this interplay and its implications on security and privacy. In this paper, we address the joint problem of application placement and user assignment. Beside capacity and latency constraints, we consider several types of security and privacy constraints: (i) module-level location constraints, (ii) user-level location constraints, (iii) co-location constraints, and (iv) k-anonymity constraints. We formalize the problem and develop an algorithm to solve it using quadratically constrained mixed integer programming. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach by applying it to an IoT system in the smart home domain. Controlled experiments on problem instances of increasing size show that the algorithm can solve even large problem instances in acceptable time.},
