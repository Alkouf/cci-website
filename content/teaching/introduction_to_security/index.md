Security is one of the most important extra-functional  property of systems. Essential yet often overlooked, security ensures that our daily transactions remain protected, that our infrastructure operates regularly and that our communication stays private and safe from unauthorized parties. The aim of Introduction to Security is to provide solid foundations on the overall security domain, starting from the core components of cryptographic theory, implementations and cryptanalysis. Subsequently, it shows how secure are used to build the cryptographic protocols deployed in our everyday life, and we continue by covering the fundamentals of operating systems' security, intrusion detection/prevention and recent research topics such as privacy-preserving technology. 

Within CCI, our research strives to develop and apply open-source, efficient, protected and tailor-made cryptographic implementations that ensure the security, privacy and availability of our society's communication infrastructure.
