abstract: The paper introduces an Agent-Oriented Programming (AOP) framework based on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model of agency. The novelty of this framework is in relying on the Actor model, instantiating each intentional agent as an autonomous micro-system run by actors. The working hypothesis behind this choice is that defining the agents via actors results in a more fine-grained modular architecture and that the execution of agent-oriented programs is enhanced (in scalability as well as in performance) by relying on robust implementations of Actor models such as Akka. The framework is benchmarked and analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively against three other AOP frameworks; Jason, ASTRA and Sarl.
