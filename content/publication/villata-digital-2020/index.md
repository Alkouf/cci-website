abstract: The combination of smart contracts with blockchain technology enables the
  authentication of the contract and limits the risks of non-compliance. In principle,
  smart contracts can be processed more efficiently compared to traditional paper-based
  contracts. However, current smart contracts have very limited capabilities with
  respect to normative representations, making them too distant from actual contracts.
  In order to reduce this gap, the paper presents an architectural analysis to see
  the role of computational artifacts in terms of various ex-ante and ex-post enforcement
  mechanisms. The proposed framework is assessed using scenarios concerning data-sharing
  operations bound by legal requirements from the General Data Protection Regulation
  (GDPR) and data-sharing agreements.
