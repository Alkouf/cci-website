The DL4lD research project aims to help the Dutch logistics sector with digitalisation of their busines processes. To do so, DL4LD focuses on the trustworthy sharing of an organizations (potentially sensitive) data. Trust that the organizationâ€™s (potentially sensitive) data is handled in a controlled and secure way, is for many organizations a prerequisite sine qua non the organization may not be prepared to share its data.

A focal point of the DL4LD research is on maintaining sovereignty by the data owner over the access, usage, processing and proliferation of his data  DL4LD shows how to digitally support sufficient trust and sovereignty enablers to establish a trustworthy data sharing relationship between two  logistic partners that didn't have so a priori.   

The DL4LD-project runs from January 2018 to December 2022.
