<h2>About Marten</h2>
<p>
After finishing my Bachelor Computer Science at the UvA, I started working as a research assistant for the AMdEx project. Next to my work, developing prototypes as a research assistant, I am finishing up my Bachelor Law. After completing my second bachelor, I will be looking for a master's programme in which I can combine my intrest in Law and Computer Science.
