<H2>About Daphnee</H2>
<p>
My name is Daphnee Chabal and I started my PhD in January 2022. Supervised by dr. Zoltan Mann, I conduct research in the theme 
of Security and Privacy in Edge AI. My research focuses on 1. understanding the criteria that secure multi party protocols must meet 
to be viable in edge computing environments, 2. understanding the effect of different model compression techniques on the overall 
performance of edge intelligence, and 3. creating fast, accurate, and secure solutions for neural network inference in edge 
computing systems. The overall aim is to bring state-of-the-art AI to resource constrained IoT settings, with data privacy 
guarantees. Neuroscientist by training, I was previously part of the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin - 
Madison and the Cambridge University's Junior Researcher Programme. I also worked as a data scientist in the aerospace and the 
email service industries. I am a United Workd College graduate.</p>
