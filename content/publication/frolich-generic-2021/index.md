abstract: Exploratory programming is a form of incremental program development in
  which the programmer can try and compare definitions, receives immediate feedback
  and can simultaneously experiment with the language, the program and input data.
  Read-Eval-Print-Loop interpreters (REPLs) and computational notebooks are popular
  tools for exploratory programming. However, their usability, capabilities and user-friendliness
  are strongly dependent on the underlying interpreter and, in particular, on the
  ad hoc engineering required to ready the underlying interpreter for incremental
  program development. To break this dependency, this paper adopts a principled approach
  and implements a so-called exploring interpreter as a back-end to support various
  development environments for exploratory programming.
